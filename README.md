# Modern News App

Modern News App is a simple news app 🗞️ which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top news headlines for different categories from the API.
The app is a guide to build Modern Android applications for all Android Developers.

The codebase focuses 👓 on following key things:
- Code structuring, style and comments
- Dependency injection 🗡
- Offline first ✈️
- Kotlin + Coroutines
- And best practices 🛠

## API key 🔑
You'll need to provide API key to fetch the news from the News Service (API). Currently the news is fetched from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

- Generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!) from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Create new file named -> `credentials.properties` in our project root folder
- Add the API key as shown below [Make sure to keep the double quotes]:
```
    NEWS_API_KEY = "<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY>"
```
- Build the app 
- Enjoyyyyy 🎉

## Libraries and tools 🛠

News App uses libraries and tools used to build Modern Android application, mainly part of Android Jetpack 🚀

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) first
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) first
- Architecture components
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection 🗡
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- Other [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) components

## Architecture

The app uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
